#  Building my own LISP

This project implements a full LISP interpreter in Python 3.X, following the [Make a Lisp process](https://github.com/kanaka/mal).

The REPL is implemented in `main.py`, including command-line functionality.

* `python3 main.py` initiates the REPL
  
* `python3 main.py <filename>.mal` reads and evaluates a .mal script
